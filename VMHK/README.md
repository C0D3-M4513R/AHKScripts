# VMHK
Stands For [VoiceMeeter](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/index.htm) HotKey

As a dependency I am using [SaifAqqad/VMR.ahk](https://github.com/SaifAqqad/VMR.ahk) and [SaifAqqad/AHK_MicMute/src/UI/OSD.ahk](https://github.com/SaifAqqad/AHK_MicMute/blob/3062e80e4bde0a7da2654629d297db2d7419b14f/src/UI/OSD.ahk).

For this script to work, you will need to have VoiceMeeter installed. The hotkeys are optimised for my use, and will probably have to be changed by yourself.
